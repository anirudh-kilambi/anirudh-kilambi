* Faraday's Laws
- relates electronic charge transferred to mass reacted

** Faraday's 1st and 2nd Laws of Electrolysis

*** 1st Law
    - Mass produced is directly proportional to the total charge passed
*** 2nd Law
    - Given two metals formed with the same amount of charge
    - The ratio of the masses of these two metals is only dependent on the identity of the two metals
      - Upon the conception of the idea of molecular weight, the ratio was found to be the ratio of their
        equivalent weights
** Examples
*** Applying Faraday's Laws with a Lead acid battery reaction
Given the reaction:
\begin{equation}
    Pb_{(s)} + PbO_{2,(s)} + 2HSO_{4,(aq)}^{-} + 2H^{+}_{(aq)} -> 2PbSO_{4, (s)} + 2H_{2}O_{(l)}
\end{equation}

This is an overall reaction, how do we determine whether or not it's a redox reaction?
    - Check for changes in oxidation states of atoms participating in the reaction.
    - If it were a redox reaction, the */oxidation state must increase/* for one atom and */decrease for another/*
